vagrant-ansible
===============

I am using this repository for learning more about Vagrant and Ansible

The box that is used in this repository is:

box name:"Official Ubuntu 13.04 daily Cloud Image amd64 (No Guest Additions)"
box url: http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/raring/current/raring-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box

My box name is called official_ubuntu_1304. You can change this name, but remember to update your vagrant files.

You can find many other vagrant boxes at http://www.vagrantbox.es

INSTALLATION

Add the vagrant box (Check the vagrant documentation)
